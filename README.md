Steganography tools for JPEG images


The code has been compiled in netbeans 7.2.1. Each folder is a separate project, e.g. J4. 
This code was written a few years back so it might not compile straight aways. You might 
get this error: package com.sun.image.codec.jpeg does not exist. 

To resolve this, please specify an additional compiler option (under Project properties -> Build ->
Compiling)   -XDignore.symbol.file

Once, the code gets compiled successfully, you can run it from the command line or the code itself. The main 
class is RunSim.java. 


A reference to the theory behind it is provided in my dissertation
